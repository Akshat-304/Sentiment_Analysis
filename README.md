# Twitter Sentiment Analysis  

## Overview  
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The analysis leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to extract meaningful insights from text data.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of raw tweet data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.).  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, fastText).  
- Training sentiment classification models such as logistic regression, SVM, or deep learning approaches.  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- Visualization of sentiment distribution and key insights.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of tweets labeled with sentiment categories. Preprocessing steps ensure data quality before training models.  

## Dependencies  
- Python (>=3.8)  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- nltk, spacy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (if deep learning models are used)  

## Usage  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to process data, train models, and analyze results.  

## Results  
The model performance is evaluated using standard NLP metrics, and visualizations help interpret sentiment trends.  

## Future Work  
- Experiment with transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa).  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy the model as a web application or API.
